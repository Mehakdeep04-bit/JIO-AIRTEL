Reliance Jio was launched to revolutionize India’s digital landscape by providing affordable, high-speed internet to bridge the connectivity gap, especially in rural areas. It aimed to democratize digital access, aligning with the government’s “Digital India” initiative, and disrupt the telecom industry with low-cost data and free voice calls. Beyond telecom, Jio marked Reliance Industries’ shift into the digital sector, leveraging the growing importance of data and fueling digital services like JioTV, JioCinema, and JioMart. By making connectivity accessible for millions, Jio played a central role in transforming India into one of the world’s largest data consumers.
